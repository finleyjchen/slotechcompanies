<p class="lead">SLO is far from slow. While small, San Luis Obispo, CA is a center of a tight-knit community of developers, marketers, designers, and other industry specialists that continue to push boundaries in technology and positively influence the world. This directory seeks to share companies and other resources located in SLO.</p>

<div class="text-grid">

I created this directory to evaluate the available tech companies to work for as a full stack developer in San Luis Obispo. I was a student at Cal Poly in a non-tech major who got my start in tech as a freelance developer here in sunny SLO. 

This simple site is a personal project created with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the data is stored in markdown on [Github](https://github.com/finleyjchen/slotechcompanies). It was built by [me](https://finleychen.dev). I have since moved to Cambridge, Massachussetts, but still would love to see the directory grow and support other students, recent grads, and other  here in SLO.
